"""
Note: Avoid using built-in std::nth_element (or analogous built-in functions in languages other than C++) when solving this challenge. Implement them yourself, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. This will be the kth largest element in sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
Example
For nums = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] and k = 2, the output should be
kthLargestElement(nums, k) = 6;
For nums = [99, 99] and k = 1, the output should be
kthLargestElement(nums, k) = 99.
Input/Output
[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)
[input] array.integer nums
Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 105,
-105 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 105.
[input] integer k
Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ k ≤ nums.length.

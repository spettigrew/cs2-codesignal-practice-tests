Setup
​
We are building a new website, and we want to know how many visitors we are getting to the website. All we care about is how many visits we've gotten in the past 5 minutes, nothing more. Your job is to build this system, but implementing two functions:
​
# This function gets called every time the site is visited.
log_visit()
​
# This function is called whenever I visit an administrator page summarizing the website traffic. It should return the number of visits in the last 5 minutes.
get_visits() -> int
​
Part I: implement these functions
​
Please implement log_visit() and get_visits().You can use a function like time.time() in Python to get the current time, if that's useful.
​
The functions need to work even if the website becomes popular. For example, if we are using a list to store timestamps, that list will need to be pruned periodically so it doesn't become millions of items long (we only need to be able to report the number of visits in the last 5 minutes anyway).
​
Depending on how you are storing timestamps, you will likely need to implement a prune function that prunes old data from that data structure, and that prune function should be called in the right places in log_visit() and get_visits().
